## 🤖 Tools & AI Used

### AI Tools Used:
- **Claude AI (by Anthropic)** - I used Claude AI
  throughout this project for:
  - Getting step by step guidance on how to start
  - Understanding Bootstrap component structure

  - Writing this README file

### ⚠️ Transparency Note:
I am clearly stating that I took help from
Claude AI as mentioned in the task guidelines.
The task said it is okay to use external tools
but to clearly mention them. I used Claude AI
only for guidance and clearing my doubts.
I wrote and understood each component myself.

### Other Tools Used:

## 😓 Challenges I Faced & How I Solved Them

### Challenge 1 - Understanding Bootstrap Grid
At first I did not understand how col-md-4 and
col-md-6 work for responsive layouts.
Solution: Studied Bootstrap documentation and
practiced with different column sizes.

### Challenge 2 - Navbar Not Collapsing on Mobile
The hamburger menu was not working on small screens.
Solution: I realized Bootstrap JS CDN script
was needed at the bottom of each page.

### Challenge 3 - Consistent Design Across Pages
Keeping same design, colors and fonts on all
3 pages was difficult to manage.
Solution: Used same navbar, footer and CSS
styles copied on every page.

### Challenge 4 - Modal Popup Connection
Connecting the button to open the modal
popup was confusing at first.
Solution: Learned about data-bs-toggle and
data-bs-target attributes from Bootstrap docs.

### Challenge 5 - Saving Files as HTML
Initially files were saving as .txt format.
Solution: Changed Save As type to All Files
in Notepad and named file as .html

### Challenge 6 - GitHub Pages Deployment
Understanding how GitHub Pages works and
getting the live link was new to me.
Solution: Followed Settings → Pages steps
carefully and waited for deployment.
